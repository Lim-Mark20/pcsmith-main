### Steps

   Before navigating to directories, create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the required variables from the docx file sent since it cannot be included in the github repo:
   
   ```env
    MONGO_URI=
    PORT=
   ```

1. Navigate to the backend/frontend directory:

   - Backend:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - Frontend:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

2. Installation (Dependencies):

   - Backend:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Frontend:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. Running the Application:

   - Backend:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Frontend:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
